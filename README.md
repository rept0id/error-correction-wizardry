# wizardry-error-correction

The purpose of this git is to expirement and discover the secrets of error correction codes.

Error correction was one of the first algorithms field to spark human interest. 

Between the **7th** and **10th** **centuries CE**, Jewish scribes formalized the `Numerical Masorah` to ensure accurate Hebrew Bible reproduction.

In the early **1950s**, `Richard W. Hamming` created his well-known error-correcting code at Bell Labs because he was frustrated with errors in punched card systems. 

**Today**, we still benefit from Hamming's workâ€”modern ECC RAM, which uses a version of Hamming's code, helps keep important data like telecommunications and banking transactions safe and reliable on servers.
